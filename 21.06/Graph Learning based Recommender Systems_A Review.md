# Abstract

Recent years have witnessed the fast development of the emerging topic of Graph Learning based Recommender Systems (GLRS). GLRS employ advanced graph learning approaches to model users’ preferences and intentions as well as items’ characteristics for recommendations. Differently from other RS approaches, including content based filtering and collaborative filtering, GLRS are built on graphs where the important objects, e.g., users, items, and attributes, are either explicitly or implicitly connected. With the rapid development of graph learning techniques, exploring and exploiting homogeneous or heterogeneous relations in graphs are a promising direction for building more effective RS. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of GLRS, by discussing how they extract important knowledge from graph-based representations to improve the accuracy, reliability and explainability of the recommendations. First, we characterize and formalize GLRS, and then summarize and categorize the key challenges and main progress in this novel research area.

# Conclusion

As one of the most important applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Recommender Systems (RS) can be found nearly at every corner of our daily lives. Graph Learning (GL), as one of the most promising AI techniques, has shown a great capability to learn the complex relations among the various objects managed by an RS. This has launched a totally new RS paradigm: Graph Learning based Recommender Systems (GLRS), which is of great potential to be the next-generation of RS. It is our hope that this review has provided a comprehensive and self contained overview of the recent progress, challenges as well as future research directions in GLRS to both the academia and industry.
