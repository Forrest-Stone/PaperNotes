# Abstract

Different from the traditional recommender system, the session-based recommender system introduces the concept of the session, i.e., a sequence of interactions between a user and multiple items within a period, to preserve the user’s recent interest. The existing work on the session-based recommender system mainly relies on mining sequential patterns within individual sessions, which are not expressive enough to capture more complicated dependency relationships among items. In addition, it does not consider the cross-session information due to the anonymity of the session data, where the linkage between different sessions is prevented. In this paper, we solve these problems with the graph neural networks technique. First, each session is represented as a graph rather than a linear sequence structure, based on which a novel Full Graph Neural Network (FGNN) is proposed to learn complicated item dependency. To exploit and incorporate cross-session information in the individual session’s representation learning, we further construct a Broadly Connected Session (BCS) graph to link different sessions and a novel Mask-Readout function to improve session embedding based on the BCS graph. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, i.e., Yoochoose and Diginetica, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposal through comparisons with state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.

# Motivation

- 会话中复杂的项目依赖关系没有学习的很好，用 GNN 去捕获
- 最重要的是，由于用户的匿名性，跨会话的信息没有考虑到

# Main Contributions

- 提出了一个 Broad Connected Session (BCS) 图将跨会话的信息融合到图里面去
- 也提出了一个 Mask-Readout 模块，当跨会话信息融合到 FGNN 的时候，用来生成会话的嵌入

# Introduction

以前的基于内容的推荐以及协同过滤都主要关注于所有的历史交互数据也就是长期兴趣。但是基于会话的推荐要更加考虑用户当前的交互项目，也就是短期兴趣。会话指的是在一个时期内（一般很短）和一个用户交互的多个项目的序列。

为什么跨会话的信息会有用呢？共享至少一个项目的会话之间的皮尔森相关系数的分布表明基准数据集的会话存在强的正相关。跨会信息可以有助于解决数据稀疏问题。

当前利用跨会话信息的方法都假定每个会话的用户 ID 可用，以便它们可用可以链接属于同一用户的会话。但是他们不适用于没有用户 ID 信息的匿名会话数据。

第一个 motivation 解决过了，看论文 FGNN[2]，本文的重点在于如何把跨会话信息融合到 FGNN 中去。而且提出的 mask-readout 模块生成会话的嵌入，更多的关注于原始会话图中的项目，而保证学习到的会话嵌入不被跨会话信息所分散。

# My Thoughts

- 这么长的篇幅我以为是类似于综述的文章，包括下一篇要看的文章都是同一批人写的，看完摘要我发现是我多想了。哈哈哈哈。原来这样的期刊还可以公开说自己是谁。而且这篇论文是 FGNN 论文的改进，很多图都一样哈哈哈，虽然我没看过基础的文章
- 赶紧记下来，我想起来了要反思的问题是，看论文太关注于过程了，纠结那些实现上的细节，应该过多的去思考 idea 的形成和发展，去思考去思考去思考问题的原因和解决方案

# Conclusion

This paper studied the problem of the session-based recommendation on anonymous sessions in the aspect of the complicated item dependency and the cross-session information. We found that a sequence or a random set of items are insufficient to capture the relation between items. To learn the complicated item dependency, we first represented each session as a graph and then proposed an FGNN model to perform graph convolution on the session graph. Furthermore, because of the data sparsity issue of the anonymous session, it is helpful to make use of the cross-session information. To exploit and incorporate the cross-session information, we further designed a BCS graph to connect different sessions and used a Mask-Readout function to generate a more expressive session embedding with the cross-session information. Empirically, the experimental results from two large-scale benchmark datasets validated the superiority of our solution compared with state-of-the-art techniques.
